# 🗑️ Trash Detection using YOLOv8 (Computer Vision)

## Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end object detection pipeline** using **YOLOv8** to detect trash/waste in **real-world, cluttered outdoor scenes**.  
The goal is to follow a **correct, industry-style workflow** rather than relying on toy or studio datasets.

---

## Key Objectives
- Build a realistic **object detection pipeline**
- Work with **messy, real-world images**
- Apply proper **train/validation splits**
- Understand **precision, recall, and mAP**
- Create a **bootstrap model** for future dataset scaling

---

## Dataset
- ~55 real-world trash images
- Outdoor, cluttered environments
- Manually annotated using **bounding boxes**
- **80/20 train–validation split**
  - Train: 49 images  
  - Validation: 10 images
- Single class:
  - `trash`

> Note: Images and labels are excluded from the repository to keep it lightweight.

---

## Model & Training
- **Model:** YOLOv8n (Ultralytics)
- **Framework:** PyTorch + Ultralytics YOLO
- **Training Configuration:**
  - Image size: `640`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Device: CPU (Apple M1)
- **Output:** Trained model weights (`best.pt`)

---

## Results (Baseline Model)
Evaluation performed on the validation set:

- **Precision:** High (predictions are usually correct)
- **Recall:** Moderate (misses some trash objects)
- **mAP@50:** ~0.54

This model is intended as a **baseline / bootstrap model**, not a final production system.

## Training Command

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=dataset/data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

---

## Inference Example

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=predict \
  model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt \
  source=path/to/images
```


## Key Learnings
- YOLO reports **validation metrics only**, not training image count
- Epoch count should decrease as **dataset size increases**
- CPU training is slow but sufficient for **pipeline validation**
- Dataset quality matters more than excessive epochs

---

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset to **100–300 images**
- Improve recall with more diverse trash scenarios
- Retrain on **GPU** for faster iteration
- Add **video-based inference** demo

---
